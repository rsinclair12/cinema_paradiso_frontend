```In this web application you will find many informative movie reviews,
you can compare different reviews on current, upcoming, recent, or
vintage movies and even get a sneak-peek at the trailers. You can filter
the movies by genre. This extension is built in a more user-friendly
manner where they can save time by loading all the currently playing
movies in a single click.
